/**
 * Provides exception classes specific to the UI framework.
 * <p>
 * This package contains custom exception types that represent various error conditions
 * and exceptional situations that can occur within the UI subsystem. These exceptions
 * help distinguish UI-specific errors from general application errors and provide
 * more precise error handling.
 * <p>
 * The primary exceptions in this package include:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@link org.bee.ui.exception.UnimplementedException} - Indicates functionality
 *       that is defined in the interface but not yet implemented in the code</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * These exceptions are designed to be thrown by UI components when appropriate and
 * caught by application code to handle UI-specific error conditions. They help maintain
 * a clear separation between UI concerns and application logic when handling errors.
 *
