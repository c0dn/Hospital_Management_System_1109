/**
 * Provides view components for the BEE UI framework terminal-based interface.
 * <p>
 * This package contains various view implementations that form the building blocks
 * of the user interface. These components work together with the core UI framework
 * ({@code org.bee.ui}) to create interactive terminal-based interfaces.
 * <p>
 * The views in this package follow a component-based design, with each view extending
 * the base {@code View} class from the parent package. Views can be composed, paginated,
 * and decorated to create complex UI layouts while maintaining consistent styling and
 * interaction patterns.
 * <p>
 * Key component categories include:
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>Basic Views</b>: Simple components like {@link org.bee.ui.views.TextView} for displaying text</li>
 *   <li><b>Container Views</b>: Components like {@link org.bee.ui.views.CompositeView} and {@link org.bee.ui.views.ListView}
 *       that contain and arrange other views</li>
 *   <li><b>Interactive Views</b>: Components like {@link org.bee.ui.views.FormView} and {@link org.bee.ui.views.MenuView}
 *       for user input and navigation</li>
 *   <li><b>Data Display Views</b>: Components like {@link org.bee.ui.views.TableView} and {@link org.bee.ui.views.DetailsView}
 *       for displaying structured data</li>
 *   <li><b>Pagination</b>: Components like {@link org.bee.ui.views.PaginatedView} and {@link org.bee.ui.views.PaginatedMenuView}
 *       for handling large datasets</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * The package also provides supporting interfaces like {@link org.bee.ui.views.UserInputResult} and
 * input handling mechanisms to create a consistent interaction model across the application.
 * <p>
 * Most views in this package integrate with the {@code Canvas} from the parent package for rendering,
 * and use common styling elements like {@code Color} and {@code TextStyle} for consistent visual presentation.
