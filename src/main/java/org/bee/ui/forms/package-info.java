/**
 * Provides a framework for creating and managing dynamic form elements and validation in the UI.
 * <p>
 * This package offers a complete solution for building interactive forms with type-safe
 * validation, data binding, and formatted display. It implements a form system that
 * can dynamically generate UI components from domain objects and handle the bidirectional
 * mapping of data between the user interface and application model.
 * <p>
 * Key features of this package include:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Generic form fields with type-safe validation and conversion</li>
 *   <li>Predefined validators for common data formats</li>
 *   <li>Adapters for converting between domain objects and form representations</li>
 *   <li>Support for required/optional field states with visual indicators</li>
 *   <li>Error messaging and validation feedback</li>
 *   <li>Reflection-based property access for flexible object mapping</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * The primary components in this package are:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@link org.bee.ui.forms.FormField} - Represents a single input field with validation
 *       and type conversion capabilities</li>
 *   <li>{@link org.bee.ui.forms.FormValidators} - Factory class providing common validators
 *       and parsers for form fields</li>
 *   <li>{@link org.bee.ui.forms.IObjectFormAdapter} - Interface for adapters that convert
 *       between domain objects and form representations</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * Typical usage involves creating form adapters for specific domain object types, which
 * generate appropriate form fields based on the object's properties. These fields can then
 * be rendered in the UI, and after user input, the form data can be applied back to the
 * domain objects.
